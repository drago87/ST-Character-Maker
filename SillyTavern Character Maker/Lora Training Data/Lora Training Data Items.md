		"short_description": "A handheld electronic device that delivers controlled electrical impulses between conductive contact points.",

		"indepth_description": "An E-Stim Device is a compact electronic control unit designed to generate low-voltage electrical signals and transmit them through connected conductive attachments. The device functions by establishing an electrical circuit between at least two contact points—one positive (anode) and one negative (cathode). Electrical effects occur only when this circuit is completed through a conductive path. Output characteristics such as intensity, timing, and pattern are adjustable via onboard controls.",

		"intended_use": "Used to apply controlled electrical stimulation for sensory experimentation, muscle response activation, or therapeutic-style electrical input in a controlled environment.",

		"operation": "The device is powered on and connected to two or more conductive attachments using electrode cables. At least one attachment must serve as a positive contact point and one as a negative contact point. Once both contacts are placed and the circuit is completed, electrical impulses travel between them according to the selected mode and intensity. The control unit itself should always be placed on a stable surface and only interacted with when turning the device on or off, adjusting settings, or changing connected addons. Addons are connected by inserting or removing electrode cables from the designated output ports on the device while the device is powered off or set to zero intensity. Attachments should be securely connected before placement, and all addon changes should be performed only when no electrical output is active.",

		"materials": "Plastic or metal casing, insulated wiring, conductive metal electrodes, silicone or rubberized insulation",

		"safety_notes": "Electrical stimulation requires a complete circuit to function. Never place contact points across the chest, head, or neck. Always begin at the lowest intensity setting. Avoid use by individuals with pacemakers, heart conditions, neurological disorders, or compromised skin integrity. Use only accessories rated for electrical stimulation.",
