    "indepth_description": "A C-String Thong is a minimal underwear item shaped like the letter \"C\" when viewed from the side.

    "how_to_wear": "The thong is positioned by placing the front panel in place and allowing the internal frame to rest naturally between the body and the garment. Proper fit is achieved through correct sizing and alignment rather than fastening or adhesion.",

The back element is typically decorative, commonly shaped like a heart, butterfly, cat, or similar motif, adding visual appeal while maintaining minimal coverage.",
		"usage_context": "Used with backless, low-rise, sheer, or form-fitting garments where traditional underwear would be visible. Commonly worn for special occasions, fashion styling, performances, or situations requiring both invisibility and decorative detail.",
		"how_to_wear": "The skin should be clean, dry, and free of oils. The front panel is positioned and pressed against the body to activate the adhesive. The thong is then aligned so the decorative back piece adheres to the lower back or upper glute area. Gentle pressure is applied to both adhesive areas to ensure secure placement. Removal is done slowly to avoid skin irritation.",
