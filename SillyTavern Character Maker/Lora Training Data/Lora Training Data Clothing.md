		"id": "breast_binding",
		"name": "Breast Binding",
		"category": "underwear_top",
		"description": "A long, soft cloth or bandage-like strip wrapped tightly around the chest to flatten, compress, and stabilize the torso.",
		"usage_context": "Used in martial arts, traditional Japanese clothing, and some combat-oriented uniforms to improve mobility and reduce chest movement.",
		"how_to_wear": "The cloth is placed under one arm and wrapped around the chest in overlapping layers. Each pass is pulled snug to create compression. The ends are tied at the back or side. Wrapping should be even to prevent discomfort or restricted breathing.",
		"materials": "Cotton, linen, soft bandage cloth",
		"notes": "Breast binding is distinct from modern sports bras; it functions more like layered compression wrappings."
