For each item (Character, Item, Kink etc..) surround it with a
```json
```
Block (The starting \`\`\`json and ending \`\`\` is needed). For example
```json
{
	"instruction": "Provide character metadata with full schema.",
	"input": "<CHARACTER NAME OR SOURCE>",
	"output": {
		"name": "Character 1",
		...
	}
}
```
```json
{
	"instruction": "Provide character metadata with full schema.",
	"input": "<CHARACTER NAME OR SOURCE>",
	"output": {
		"name": "Character 2",
		...
	}
}
```

To convert the json format to jsonl (the recommended format for oobabooga to train a lora) drop the .md file on the "run_md_to_jsonl.bat" it will create a .jsonl file in the right format saved in the 'jsonl' folder in same folder as the scripts and .bat files.

To combine the different .jsonl files to one file drop all of them (or the folder containing the .jsonl files) on the 'combine_jsonl.bat' file. It will combine them and save it to the 'Dataset' folder
