I'm creating LoRA training data for a language model. Below is the template we will use for making a [template_name] schema:

Replace this line with the template. Also replace [template_name] with the actual type of schema being created (e.g., Action, Character, Anatomical Size, Archetype, etc.).

Your tasks:

1. Define new schema instances that follow this template.
2. Update existing schema entries if missing fields, errors, or improvements are identified.
3. Ensure all required fields, placeholder conventions, and example structures are correctly applied.
4. If any instruction or input is unclear or inconsistent, ask for clarification before generating output.
5. Always return the completed schema in a JSON markdown block (or canvas-style block) suitable for direct use in training.

The first schema we will create should correspond to the `schema_type` specified in this template. Be precise, thorough, and consistent in applying the template structure.
