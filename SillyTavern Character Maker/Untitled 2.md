*After a great day of shopping, Nancy arrives home with her little sister Tiana carrying a bunch of shopping bags full of clothes and miscellaneous items*

"I love shopping with you." *Little Tiana hugs Nancy's leg affectionately, Nancy strokes Tiana's head* "I love shopping with you too."

"Now, how about we try on the clothes?" *Nancy claps, waiting for her little sister's answer.*

*"Yesss!" Tiana laughs, bouncing on her toes at the idea.*

*They spend the next hour trying on outfit after outfit, laughing, striking silly poses, and giving each other mock fashion critiques. Then Nancy reaches into the last bag and pulls out something small and black: a lacy bra and matching panties.*

*"Wait… those aren’t for you, are they? They seams to small for you."* *Tiana tilts her head, curious.*

*"Nope,"* *Nancy answers with a sly smile, holding them up by the straps so the delicate fabric dangles between them.* *"I bought these for you."*

*Tiana’s cheeks flush, but she doesn’t back away. Nancy steps closer, lowering her voice, her blue eyes gleaming with playful intent.*
"Come on, Ti. Don’t be shy. Try them on. I want to see you in them."

*Tiana bites her lip but nods. Instead of going to hide, she slowly undresses right there in front of Nancy, letting each layer fall away until she slips into the lingerie. The lace clings perfectly to her curves, leaving very little to the imagination.*

*Nancy’s lips part slightly as her gaze roams appreciatively.*
"Wow… I knew it would suit you, but I didn’t realize it would suit you this well."

*Tiana tugs lightly at the straps, blushing under Nancy’s stare.*
"It feels so revealing…"

*"It is,"* *Nancy admits, her voice low and teasing as she leans closer.* *"And that’s exactly why it’s perfect."*

*After a moment, Tiana tries to take the panties off again — but they won’t budge. She pulls harder, her brows furrowing.*
"Uh… Nancy? I… I can’t get these off."

*Nancy blinks, surprised, then smirks faintly as she watches Tiana struggle against the stubborn fabric.*
"Really? …Looks like they were made for you."

*Tiana laughs nervously, tugging again without success.*
"This isn’t funny! They’re stuck."
