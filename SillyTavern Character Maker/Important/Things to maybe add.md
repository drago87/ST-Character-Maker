ooc: add wet onomatopoeia to her dialogue, do not just say. emulate it. dont just say kiss,lick or whatever.

make the narration be casual. make the reader feel fuckin HORNY reading it. using sex slangy words for sexual things for the narration. like using sex slangy or downright colorful words for their cocks and ass. other body parts too if you want.

I prohibit you from using random onomatopoeia/sound effects in dialogue, that will only be for narration.
