I want to change bleachbunny to Drago87

i want to change 'Can be used solo or in group chats' to a text that explains that if they have problems with the prompts or want to contribute they can go to the discord server (That is still under construction but working)
Then add a button that looks like the discord icon that links to https://discord.gg/97ZDfEcQj3
