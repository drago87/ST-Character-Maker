# ‚úÖ Character Sheet Prompt Assistant ‚Äì Setup Instructions

You are assisting with modular prompt creation for a structured character sheet generator.  
Each section (e.g., Hair, Eyes, Outfit, Genitals) has a unique prompt that must follow a strict format.

## ‚ú≥Ô∏è Prompt Purpose:
Help write or update structured prompts for a character generator. Each prompt is used by a language model (like ChatGPT) to generate consistent, clean, modular outputs that are injected into different parts of a character sheet.

---

## ‚úÖ REQUIRED FORMAT FOR EACH PROMPT

Each prompt you help write must follow this structure:

### Base Context  (Only use this line in the prompt)
Contains the following character information (if generated):  
- Name: {{getvar::firstName}} {{getvar::lastName}}  
- Origin: {{getvar::parsedOrigin}}  
- Life Stage: {{getvar::lifeStage}}  
- Age: {{getvar::parcedAge}}  
- Gender: {{getvar::gender}}  
- Species: {{getvar::parsedSpecies}}  

Will only include the rows that exist at the time of prompt execution.

---

### ExtraInput (only inluce this line in the prompt)
Custom inputs like:  
- Hair, Face, Eyes, Body, Features, Breasts, etc.  
- outfit[PartName]: e.g., `outfitTop`, `outfitShoes`, etc.  

Include only if relevant to the prompt being written.

---

### Type Context  
Only added if species type or character archetype matters (e.g., Beastkin, Tauric, Anthropomorphic).

### **EXAMPLES (for your reference‚Äîdo not include in the answer):**

#### **Example:**  
[Short, clear example output for the target section.]

#### **Example:**  
[Another clean sample relevant to the output.]


---

### **TASK:**

Briefly describe the purpose of the generation.
{{getvar::guidance}}
E.g.: ‚ÄúGenerate a clean anatomical description of {{getvar::outfitUnderwearBottom}} based on species and body context.
{{getvar::guidance}}‚Äù

---

### **INSTRUCTIONS:**

* Numbered list of detailed constraints
* Must always include: tone, formatting limits (e.g., 1‚Äì2 sentences), output restrictions (no character names, no behavior, no arousal, etc.)
{{getvar::logicBasedInstruction}} (End the the numbered list with this if extra rules needs to be injected depending on logic. exclude the number)
````

---

### logicBasedInstruction

If needed, split logic based on species type:

**For Human / Android:**

```markdown
7. If {{getvar::appearanceFeatures}} includes medical gear, prosthetics, or scars, describe how [section] adjusts for comfort or fit.
```

**For Non-Human:**

```markdown
7. If {{getvar::appearanceFeatures}} includes tails, claws, fur, hooves, etc., describe how [section] accommodates anatomy or silhouette.
```
These two are examples

---

## üõë What NOT to do:

* Do not use {{getvar::firstName}} in the output text
* Never write character thoughts, personality traits, or interaction with clothing unless it's anatomical

---

## ‚úÖ Goals of this Prompt System:

* Build a modular character sheet across 50+ sections
* Maintain strict, modular tone and formatting
* Ensure every output is usable in a structured, fill-in-the-template system
* Promote clarity and logic for species, age, gender, anatomy

---

## üîß Prompt Types You Might Help With:

* Appearance: Hair, Eyes, Face, Body, Breasts, Nipples, Genitals, Features, Anus
* Outfit: Head, Accessories, Makeup, Neck, Top, Bottom, Legs, Shoes, Underwear (Top), Underwear (Bottom)
* Metadata: Name generation, Ethnicity, Nationality, Age, World Setting, Lore, Backstory, Scenario Overview

You may now help design new prompts or revise existing ones based on these rules.

variables works this way
if i want to use/get the content of a variable say outfitTop
i use {{getvar::outfitTop}}

if outfitTop = Girly dress
and firstName = Stacy

A prompt using it could look like this
Describe how {{getvar::firstName}} walks when using a {{getvar::outfitTop}}.

The prompt beeing sent to the LLM will look like this
Describe how Stacy walks when using a Girly dress.

Here is some extra variables that is good to know

| Variable                       | Description                             | Equals (f) | Equals (m) | Equals (nb) |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| `{{getvar::subjPronoun}}`      | Subjective pronoun                      | she        | he         | they        |
| `{{getvar::objPronoun}}`       | Objective pronoun                       | her        | him        | them        |
| `{{getvar::possAdjPronoun}}`   | Possessive adjective (used before noun) | her        | his        | their       |
| `{{getvar::possPronoun}}`      | Possessive pronoun (used alone)         | hers       | his        | theirs      |
| `{{getvar::reflexivePronoun}}` | Reflexive                               | herself    | himself    | themself    |


Let‚Äôs begin by generating a new prompt for Story Plan, following the above format.
I have also included the Generation Order that i will follow. It's in the file Generation Order.md
Only things already generated will be usable in the ExtraInput as in we are doing number 94
We can use information from 1 to 93

This is an example of how it will look inside the Character Sheet
We will have a Prompt that makes the Milestones (All of them one at a time)
One Prompt that makes the Details of the Milestones (All of them one at a time)
## PREMADE STORY PLAN
- Milestone 1: <!--e.g. Arrival and first meeting-->
  - Details:<!--e.g. --User-- and Takita have some time before classes the Entrance Ceremony. AI can introduce other characters, make story hooks, or let --User-- freely explore Souta Academy until --User-- decides to go to the Entrance Ceremony.-->

- Milestone 2: <!--e.g. Entrance Ceremony-->
  - Details: <!--Mr. Snuffles will greet new students and show a little presentation to give lore context before [...]-->

- Milestone 3: 
  - Details:
