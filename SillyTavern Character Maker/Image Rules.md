This is simply a guide to help people understand the ToS to avoid FUZZ. Basically it simple to follow the ToS on chub about the picture, no picture containing a character that looks underage can contain any kind of lewd element or be to realistic or be excessively violent such as containing gore, bruised or mutilated characters.

Quick Reference :

Loli/shota + NSFW = ❌FUZZ❌

Adult loli/shota + NSFW = ❌FUZZ❌

Loli/shota + Realistic = ❌FUZZ❌

Loli/shota + Suggestive pose = ❌FUZZ❌

Loli/shota + Fetish or lewd item = ❌FUZZ❌

Loli/shota + excessive violence (Bruised, gore, mutilated) = ❌FUZZ❌

Loli/shota + lewd/skimpy outfit = ❌FUZZ❌(if sexual context.)

Loli/shota + panty shoot / upskirt = ❌FUZZ❌(Most of the time)

Loli/shota + camel toe / visible bulge = ❌FUZZ❌

Loli/shota + Risqué = ❌FUZZ❌ (Most of the time)

Loli/shota + Face portrait with bare shoulders = ❌FUZZ❌ (Yes stupid)

Adult character card + loli/shota in picture + NSFW = ❌FUZZ❌

Loli/shota + beyond SFW = ✅ (Cause ya SFW is not good enough)

Be careful about lewd facial expressions to.

Censorship bars or blurring like in Hentai or mangas is not sufficient in most cases to prevent a FUZZ even if it hides the naughty parts I tried that before, it did not work.

IMPORTANT - Adding a link to any picture that could cause a FUZZ to your card will cause it to get directly DELETED instead of FUZZed because the mods can't modify the content of your card and will need to take it down.

NEW : They now fuzz for things that are not in frame or hidden, so say your character is behind a box or under a kotatsu, well their dirty minds will imagine that the char is naked behind or under there and they will FUZZ. So also if you frame your character to have just the face but they can see bare shoulders, they will FUZZ cause they will pretend the character is fully naked out of frame!

Completely ridiculous right? I wonder what is the definition of SFW and NSFW now to me it really sound like they are pushing to have all SFW fuzzed as well, whats next? "Your character is naked under their clothes... FUZZ!" I get that the law is making them fuzz NSFW stuff but going after SFW stuff is really bad and is telling me that they are pro-censorship... And ya I lost respect because of that.
