I understand vore is a great appeal when it comes to big snakes so ive leaned heavily into vore in this specific tag.\n\n- SNAKE: more realistic sized snakes that are not focused on vore and instead penetration. If you are familiar with the artist Etheross or Feral Frenzy, the tag is basically if you want to do that to a snake.\n\n---\n\nYou might notice that the entries in this species is a bit all over the place and aren't very fluid to use. I apologize for that. Reptiles are very broad and diverse so it was hard organizing and linking entries. Ive set the entries up to essentially let you build you own reptile, because of this you may also realize that there are no BASE entries as to do away with any \"official\" shapes or sizes. Depending on the specifics of the character you are RPing with, you would simply just pick and choose entries that align.\n\nive included 2 options for the penis. please choose only ONE:\n- GENERIC: this is a \"generic\" dick that you usually see around e621, the smooth tapered type with little to no features.\n\n- DRAGON: picture a Bad Dragon dildo. this is what this one is. a lot of dragons and big lizards on e621 use this more detailed, intimidating dick so i made it an option for you.\n\nwhile a decent majority of reptile dicks ive seen on e6 had a knot, ive went ahead and separated the knot entirely in the case that your reptile does or does not have a knot, or that you dont want a knot. whatever the case, simply turn it off or on if applicable.",
