Tauric often have entire lower bodies or torsos resembling those of animals or mythical creatures.\n\n#### **EXAMPLE – Centaur:**\nCentaurs have a fully human upper torso fused where the neck of a horse would be. The lower body is equine, including four legs, hooves, and a tail. This body plan results in:\n- A large, horizontal quadrupedal base supporting a vertical human torso.\n- Reproductive anatomy is located where it would be on a typical horse — beneath the rear flanks, between the hind legs.\n- Human-like emotions, facial expressions, and speech.\n- Movement and balance based on horse-like locomotion, with upright gestures supported by the human torso.\n\n#### **EXAMPLE – Mermaid / Merman:**\nMermaids possess a human upper body connected to a long, scaled fish tail in place of legs. Their lower anatomy merges below the hips into a continuous tail, typically with fins at the end.\n- No external genitalia are visible.\n- Reproductive anatomy is placed at a concealed slit-like opening where the human pelvis meets the tail.\n- In sexualized settings, the genital slit may function similarly to that of aquatic mammals (like dolphins or cetaceans).\n- Mermaids typically require water to move fluidly and may struggle with upright balance on land unless magically adapted.\n\n#### **EXAMPLE – Lamia / Naga:**\nThese creatures have a human upper body with a long serpentine lower half.\n- Movement is done via coiling and slithering; balance comes from tail tension, not legs.\n- Reproductive anatomy is located just below the human waist or embedded in a retractable cloacal slit along the upper tail.\n- Because of the tail’s thickness and flexibility, Lamias can coil around others or rear up like cobras.\n\n#### **EXAMPLE – Drider (Spider Centaur):**\nDriders feature a humanoid upper half connected to the body of a giant spider.\n- The spider abdomen is horizontal with eight legs, and the human torso emerges where a spider’s head would be.\n- Reproductive anatomy is typically located on the underside of the spider's rear or just behind the humanoid pelvis, depending on interpretation.\n- They can move vertically or scale surfaces easily, but may struggle with humanoid chairs, beds, or clothing.\n\n#### **EXAMPLE – Harpy:**\nHarpies are bird-like humanoids with wings instead of arms and clawed bird legs.\n- Their bodies are often fully human-shaped from the torso up, but their lower halves feature avian talons and plumage.\n- Reproductive anatomy is often cloacal, like birds, and located beneath feathered coverage between the legs.\n- Mobility may include hopping or short glides rather than walking in a bipedal stance.\n\nUse the anatomical examples above to infer similar traits for other tauric species not listed here.  \nBase placement and posture on the most anatomically similar real-world or fantasy creature (e.g., goat, shark, deer).",
