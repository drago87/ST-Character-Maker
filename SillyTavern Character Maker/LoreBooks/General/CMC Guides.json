If you feel that when you use Guidance that the generation is not listening you can add a ': Guide' to 'CMC Generation Prompts'\n\nExamples needs to be there but can be empty. Here you put examples on what type of outputs you want.\n\nTask needs to be there and will be the main part of the prompt that specifies what will be generated. {{getvar::guidance}} should be precent here for it to work. \n\nInstruction needs to be there and will be the rules that it should follow when making the generation.\n\nvariables vill look like this {{getvar::variableName}} and will contain generated or static information that is based in earlier generations or selections.",
