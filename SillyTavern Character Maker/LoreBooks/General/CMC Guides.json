Here you put examples on what type of outputs you want.\n\nTask needs to be there and will be the main part of the prompt that specifies what will be generated.\n\nInstruction needs to be there and will be the rules that it should follow when making the generation.\n\nvariables vill look like this {{getvar::variableName}} and will contain generated or static information that is based in earlier generations or selections.",
