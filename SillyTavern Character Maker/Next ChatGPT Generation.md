I did not mean to add something like this
MANDATORY GUIDANCE:
You must use {{getvar::guidance}} as the **conceptual anchor** when generating the scene.
- Draw only from the **core atmosphere or purpose** of this guidance.
- Never copy, paraphrase, or restate its words directly.
- If {{getvar::guidance}} is empty, you must still generate a valid scene without delay or filler.
- Treat violations of this guidance as strictly invalid.

and this would not work as if guidance would be empty this is how it would look
MANDATORY GUIDANCE:
You must useas the **conceptual anchor** when generating the scene.
- Draw only from the **core atmosphere or purpose** of this guidance.
- Never copy, paraphrase, or restate its words directly.
- Ifis empty, you must still generate a valid scene without delay or filler.
- Treat violations of this guidance as strictly invalid. 

or if we would input the guidance
MANDATORY GUIDANCE:
You must use **GUIDANCE:**
**Use** the following as a conceptual anchor or inspirational seed. It represents the type of setting being generated. You **must** draw from its core idea, purpose, or atmosphere — but do **not** copy or paraphrase it directly:
[This is when Emma's mother leave Emma at the research institute.] as the **conceptual anchor** when generating the scene.
- Draw only from the **core atmosphere or purpose** of this guidance.
- Never copy, paraphrase, or restate its words directly.
- If **GUIDANCE:**
**Use** the following as a conceptual anchor or inspirational seed. It represents the type of setting being generated. You **must** draw from its core idea, purpose, or atmosphere — but do **not** copy or paraphrase it directly:
[This is when Emma's mother leave Emma at the research institute.] is empty, you must still generate a valid scene without delay or filler.
- Treat violations of this guidance as strictly invalid.


What i meant was to rewrite the
'**GUIDANCE:**
**Use** the following as a conceptual anchor or inspirational seed. It represents the type of setting being generated. You **must** draw from its core idea, purpose, or atmosphere — but do **not** copy or paraphrase it directly:'


The '[This is when Emma's mother leave Emma at the research institute.]' part is added later with code at the end (including the newline)
