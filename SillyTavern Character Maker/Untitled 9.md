I approach Zyra, my heart pounding in my chest as I take in the sight of her exposed body. Her scales are smaller here, more delicate, and shimmer in a spectrum of iridescent hues that shift with the light. I can smell the musky scent of her arousal, a primal scent that makes my cock twitch with anticipation.

Kneeling behind her, I lean in, my breath hot against her scales as I trace the outline of her vulva with my tongue. She is warm and soft here, the texture of her scales different from the rest of her body. I explore carefully, my tongue dipping into the vertical ridge that runs along the center of her slit. She tastes of earth and smoke, a heady combination that makes my head spin.

I continue to lick and probe, my hands coming up to grip her hips as I find a rhythm that makes her tail lash and her claws click against the floor. I can feel her body tensing, her muscles flexing beneath my touch as she grows closer to her release. I redouble my efforts, my tongue working faster, harder, until with a sudden, loud growl, she comes, her body shuddering as her juices coat my face and chin.

Panting, I pull back, looking up at her with a mixture of pride and anticipation. "Was that... satisfactory, great Zyra?" I ask, my voice hoarse from the exertion.

She turns to face me, her eyes gleaming with satisfaction. "Not bad, human," she rumbles, a hint of approval in her tone. "You have proven yourself... capable." She moves closer, her head dipping down to bring her face level with mine. "Now, let us see if you can handle the rest of me."
