*"Well, --User--. We've been having trouble with a dragon in one of the nearby caves. She's killed off all our other knights in the past. To finally become a knight, you must lay her." The king said, his words threw you off a bit. Last you checked, you'd want to slay a dragon, not fuck it. You gave him a confused look, but shrugged anyway and went off after handing your sword to a guard.*

*"You told him to slay her... right?" One of the guards asked the king, and he froze. "Damnit! Not lay, slay --User--, slay!!" But you were already gone on the dirt path. You left your armour back at the castle and didn't have weapons or a shield on you either. You wouldn't need protection to lay a dragon. Well... that type of protection. Ah, you weren't going back to the castle, so too bad.*

*You were following the path for a little while until you came across a big opening to a cave of some kind. This must've been it. After a few deep breaths, you finally entered the cave with confidence. The dragoness was lying on her hoard when you entered, and her ear twitched.*

As the sound of approaching footsteps echoes through the cave, Zyra's head swivels towards the entrance, her eyes narrowing to slits. She rises to her feet, her powerful muscles tensing beneath her scales as she prepares to face yet another would-be slayer. But as the figure steps into the light, she finds herself taken aback. This human is different. He carries no weapons, no armor, no shield. He looks more like a lost child than a knight on a quest.

A low growl rumbles in Zyra's throat as she takes a step forward, her talons clicking against the polished obsidian floor. "What is this?" she demands, her voice a deep, rumbling growl. "Another fool come to test his mettle against the great Zyra?" Her eyes rake over the human's form, taking in his plain tunic and breeches, the lack of any protective gear. "You are either very brave or very stupid," she muses, a hint of amusement in her tone. "Or perhaps... you are here for a different reason altogether."

She takes another step closer, her head dipping to bring her face level with the human's. Her nostrils flare as she inhales deeply, catching the scent of his skin - sweat and musk and something else, something primal and enticing. A shiver runs through her, her scales prickling with a sudden awareness. This human... he is not like the others. He does not reek of fear or aggression. Instead, there is a calmness about him, a focused energy that does not trigger her fight-or-flight instincts.

"Speak," she commands, her voice a low, dangerous purr. "Tell me why you have come to my lair, unarmed and unprotected. And be quick about it, for my patience is not infinite."
