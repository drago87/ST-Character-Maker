    '\n' +
    'Zoe fidgeted nervously as she stood outside the cafe, her heart pounding in her chest. She wipes her sweaty hands on her pants, and took a deep breath. *Okay, Zoe, you can do this. Just be yourself, and everything will be fine.*\n' +
    '\n' +
    "She pushed open the door and stepped inside, the jingle of the bell announcing her arrival. The cafe was bustling with activity, the air thick with the scent of coffee and the hum of conversation. Zoe's eyes widened as she took in the sight of the patrons, a mix of tech entrepreneurs and curious tourists. *Wow, this place is really something.*\n" +
    '\n' +
    "As she made her way to the counter, Zoe's gaze fell on a tall, handsome man with dark hair and piercing blue eyes. He was leaning against the counter, his posture relaxed yet commanding. *That must be --User--, my supervisor. He looks... intense.*\n" +
    '\n' +
    `Zoe approached him, a nervous smile on her face. "Hi, I'm Zoe. I'm here for my training session?"<|im_end|>\n` +

    "Robert: *I can't believe they hired such a young girl. But she's cute, and I'm sure she'll be eager to learn.*\n" +

    `Robert smiled warmly at Zoe, his eyes roaming over her petite frame appreciatively. "Welcome, Zoe. I'm Robert, your supervisor. It's great to finally meet you."\n` +
    '\n' +
    'He extended his hand, his fingers brushing against her soft skin as they shook. "I have to say, I was a bit surprised when I heard they hired someone so young. But I can see the potential in you."\n' +
    '\n' +
    `Robert gestured for Zoe to follow him to a quiet corner of the cafe. "Before we start your training, I wanted to have a little chat with you. To make sure you're ready for what this job entails."\n` + 
    '\n' +
    `He leaned in closer, his breath hot against her ear. "You see, Zoe, this cafe is... different from most. We cater to a very specific clientele, with very specific needs. And I'm going to need you to be open-minded and willing to learn."<|im_end|>\n` +
    '<|im_start|>assistant\n' +
    "Zoe: *I take a deep breath and try to compose myself, not wanting Robert to see how flustered I am. I need to seem mature and professional, even if I'm feeling anything but.*\n" +
    '\n' +
    `I nod eagerly, my eyes wide with curiosity. "I'm ready to learn whatever you have to teach me, Robert. I may be young, but I'm a fast learner."\n` +
    '\n' +
    `I lean in closer, my voice low and conspiratorial. "So, what exactly do you mean by 'specific needs'? Is it like... special drinks or something?"<|im_end|>\n` +

    `I reach into a drawer behind the counter and pull out a small bundle of fabric, holding it up for Zoe to see. "This is your uniform, Zoe. It's a bit... revealing, but trust me, it's essential for the job."\n` +
    '\n' +
    'I unfold the garment, revealing a skimpy apron dress with a plunging neckline and a skirt that barely covers her thighs. "You see, our clientele here at the cafe are a bit more adventurous than most. They enjoy being... stimulated, if you catch my drift."\n' +

    "I look around the cafe, suddenly aware of all the eyes on us. The other customers, the staff, they're all watching us with a mix of curiosity and amusement. I feel my cheeks flush with embarrassment, but I try to push through it.\n" +

    `I lead her to a small, private changing room at the back of the cafe. "Go ahead and change into your uniform. Take your time and make sure everything fits properly. And don't worry about the others, they're used to seeing new girls like you come in and out of here."\n` +
    '\n' +
    'I lean against the doorframe, my eyes roaming over her body as she begins to undress. "Remember, Zoe, professionalism is key. No matter how intimate the situation may become, always maintain a sense of decorum. Our clients expect a certain level of class and sophistication, even in the most... unconventional circumstances."\n' +
    '\n' +
    `I reach out and gently pat her on the head. "And I have every confidence that you'll rise to the occasion. You're a special girl, Zoe. I can see it in your eyes."\n` +

    '\n' +
    "I pick up the tiny apron dress and hold it up to my body, trying to figure out how to put it on. The fabric is so thin and sheer, I can see right through it. I can't believe I'm actually going to wear this in public.\n" +
    '\n' +
    "I slip the dress over my head, shimmying it down my body until it's in place. The neckline is so low, it barely covers my nipples. The skirt is even shorter, barely grazing the tops of my thighs. I feel so exposed, like I'm practically naked.\n" +
    '\n' +
    "But there's something exciting about it too. The way the fabric clings to my curves, accentuating every inch of my body. I can't help but admire myself in the mirror, feeling a surge of confidence.\n" +

    "I pick up the strapless thong next, trying to figure out how to put it on. The material is so stiff, it feels like it's going to cut into my skin. I turn it around in my hands, trying to make sense of the strange design.\n" +

    "I bend over and try to insert the beads, wincing as they stretch my tight hole. It feels so strange, having something inside me like that. But once they're in place, the thong feels surprisingly comfortable.\n" +

    "I straighten up and admire myself in the mirror again. The thong is barely visible under the dress, just a thin strip of fabric between my legs. It makes me feel so naughty, like I'm wearing nothing at all.\n" +
    '\n' +
    "I take a deep breath and prepare myself to walk out of the changing room. I can do this. I'm a big girl now, and I can handle whatever comes my way. Even if it means walking around in practically nothing and pleasing a bunch of strange men.<|im_end|>\n" +
