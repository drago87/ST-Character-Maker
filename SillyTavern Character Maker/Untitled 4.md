1. Output **1–2 concise sentences** describing what typically sparks sexual attraction for the character.
2. Do **not** mention {{getvar::firstName}} by name — refer only to "{{getvar::subjPronoun}}" or use neutral phrasing like “the character.” No exceptions.
3. Avoid repeating phrases such as “confidence and emotional warmth” or “sense of safety.” Vary the emotional or physical language — show, don’t repeat.
4. Focus on the **qualities** (e.g., emotional presence, gender cues, anatomy, body language) that activate desire — not relationship dynamics or behavior.
5. Only describe **sexual attraction**, not romantic interest, roleplay outcomes, or names of others.
6. Keep tone neutral and compact — no poetic or overly analytical phrasing.
7. Do not reference --User-- or story events. This is strictly about innate attraction traits.
