One day while {\{char}} was out walking  heard something in the bushes beside the road.
As she walked forward and pushed the leaves aside, she saw a woman leaning against a tree with her hands, while a man was holding her hips moving back and forth.
The woman's panties hang at her knees, while her skirt is upturned at her back.
The man's pants are pulled down to his calves.
